# Question

What are "static assets"? How do you generate static assets in a React project?

# Answer
Static assets are HTML, CSS, and JS files. To generate static assets in a React project, you would need to 'build' the project which means to: import a path to the static files, make an absolute path to the static assets folder using `path.join()`, then create middleware using `express.static()`, finally , use app.use() to serve static assets.

Solid start! You got it right that static assets are HTML, CSS, and JS files. They’re called "static" because they don’t change or get processed by the server—they’re served exactly as they are. Every user gets the same file, no matter what.

Also, instead of focusing on how to serve those files, you need to mention how to actually generate them. In a React project, you’d run npm run build, which bundles and optimizes your code into static files in the build folder. Just a little more detail and you’ve got it!
