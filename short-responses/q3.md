# Question

What are "static assets"? How do you generate static assets in a React project?

# Answer
Static assets are HTML, CSS, and JS files. To generate static assets in a React project, you would need to 'build' the project which means to: import a path to the static files, make an absolute path to the static assets folder using `path.join()`, then create middleware using `express.static()`, finally , use app.use() to serve static assets.
